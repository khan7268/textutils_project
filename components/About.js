                "TextUtils" often refers to a suite of tools or functions designed to process, manipulate, and analyze text data. In programming and data processing, TextUtils typically includes various functionalities that help in:

                String Manipulation: Functions for trimming, splitting, concatenating, padding, and formatting strings.

                Text Analysis: Methods for word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and n-gram generation.

                Text Cleaning: Removal of special characters, whitespace, stop words, and HTML tags to prepare text data for further processing.

                Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words, sentences, or other elements, often for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

                Case Conversion: Converting text to uppercase, lowercase, or title case.

                Regular Expressions: Using regex patterns to search, replace, or validate specific text structures within strings.
